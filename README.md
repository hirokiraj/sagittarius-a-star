# Saggitarius-A* - hirokiraj's dotfiles collection
```...Sagittarius A* is mostly dormant and only occasionally absorbs gas or dust, but nonetheless has an estimated mass millions times that of our sun...```

## What's included
- Installation script - [Singularity](singularity.zsh) - run-once and obtain everything with brew
- Dotfiles for what I use in terminal

Your are good to go!
